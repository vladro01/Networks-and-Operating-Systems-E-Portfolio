    "\n",
    "The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented and reliable transport protocol. Unlike UDP, TCP ensures the following:  \n",
    "- **Reliable data transmission**:  The data is received in order and without  any errors.  \n",
    "- **Connection management**: It establishes a connection before communication  even begins.  \n",
    "- **Flow control**: This prevents overwhelming a receiver with too much data.\n",
    "- **Error recovery**: It retransmits lost or corrupted data/packets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "| **Feature**       | **TCP** (Reliable) | **UDP** (Fast, Unreliable) |\n",
    "|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n",
    "| Connection       | Connection-oriented | Connectionless |\n",
    "| Reliability      | Ensures ordered & complete delivery | No guarantees of order or delivery |\n",
    "| Use Case        | Web browsing, emails, file transfer | Streaming, gaming, VoIP |\n",
    "\n",
    "This seminar  will cover **TCP client-server applications**, **multi-client handling**, and **file transfer** using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful information for the exercise below:  \n",
    "-socket.SOCK_STREAM specifies  the use of TCP.  \n",
    "-listen(1) enables the server to accept connections (1 queued connection).  \n",
    "-accept() blocks until a client connects, returning a new socket for that client.  \n",
    "-sendall() ensures all data is sent (unlike send()).  "
