    "## Tracert process\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "|First Packet (TTL = 1)| The first packet has a TTL of 1. This means it will expire after the first hop (the first router it comes across).Then the router sends an ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) **\"Time Exceeded\"** message back to the sender (your computer). tracert  then records the IP address and round-trip time (RTT) of this router.|\n",
    "|Second Packet (TTL = 2)|The second packet has a TTL of 2, so it can travel up to two hops. It will reach the second router, which will then send a **\"Time Exceeded\"** message back. tracert records this router's information.|\n",
    "|Subsequent Packets|This process continues, with the TTL increasing by **one for each packet**, until the packet reaches its  destination. When the end point  is reached, it responds with an ICMP **\"Echo Reply\"** text|"

    "## How This Script Works\n",
    "\n",
    "This script functions as a **basic web browser** using Python's `socket` library to communicate with a web server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Create a Socket\n",
    "- Initializes a TCP socket (Transmission Control Protocol).  \n",
    "- TCP ensures reliable, ordered, and error-free data delivery.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Connect to the Server\n",
    "- Establishes a connection to `www.example.com` on **port 80** (standard HTTP port).\n",
    "- This links the Python script (acting as a client) to the web server.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Send an HTTP Request\n",
    "- Constructs an HTTP GET request to retrieve the homepage (`/`).  \n",
    "- Includes the Host header to specify the domain name.  \n",
    "- Uses `\\r\\n` to separate HTTP headers correctly.  \n",
    "- Sends the request over the socket.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Receive the Response\n",
    "- Waits for the server's response.  \n",
    "- Uses `recv()` to receive HTTP headers and HTML content.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Print the Response\n",
    "- Displays the server response, including:  \n",
    "  - HTTP headers\n",
    "  - HTML content of the web page.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Close the Socket\n",
    "- Closes the socket connection, terminating communication with the server.\n"
